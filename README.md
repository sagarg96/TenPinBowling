# Ten Pin Bowling
A JavaScript program modeled to accept the number of pins knocked down in a bowling game (even if incomplete) and return the final score based on the rules of Ten Pin Bowling. Rules can be found at  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling#Scoring and http://bowling.about.com/od/rulesofthegame/a/bowlingscoring.htm.

Note: Please simply modify the test string data (inputStr) in the program to test for different results.
